### Author
- Jay Patel

### Abstract
The UPC decoding project decodes a grayscale UPC image and returns correct UPC number. 

### Environment
- Matlab

### Theory Topics
- Discrete-Time Convolution
- FIR Filters
- Image Processing

### Example
The following image has been successfully decoded by the matlab script OFFV3_Decoder
